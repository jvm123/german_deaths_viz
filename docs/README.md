# Death Count by Cause, Germany, 2000-2022

Language: [x] English [ ] [Deutsch](README_DE)

## Intro

This page shows visualizations of the death counts per cause of death in the time frame 2000 to 2022 for Germany.

Each graph shows the development over time. The total death count is normed by the population size in the respective year, but the individual age groups are **not** normed by their actual size.

<em>-- Julian von Mendel, Dec 2023</em>

## Interpretation of the data
Be careful when interpreting these data! First, scales in the graphs vary. An example for this are the first two graphics: There are about 26 times as many deaths for accidents and their late effects as compared to accidental poisoning. You can only tell that by looking at the scale.

Most developments have a plausible and simple reason. E.g., the apparently worsening situation for the age group 80+ is largely a simple consequence of the average age in that age group increasing.

Also, the size of the respective age groups vary from year to year, and this was **not** adjusted for. E.g., when more children are born, more deaths in the age group <20 will be observed, and the development in the graphics does therefore not necessarily indicate any change in the environment.
