Go visit https://jvm123.github.io/sterbefallzahlen_viz/ to see the page with plots.

## Intro

This page shows visualizations of the death counts per cause of death in the time frame 2000 to 2022 for Germany.

Each graph shows the development over time. The total death count "Insgesamt" is normed by the population size in the respective year, but the individual age groups are **not** normed by their actual size.

## Data sources
The source of the case numbers is [Destatis Genesis](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online#astructure) (search for "Gestorbene: Deutschland, Jahre, Todesursachen, Altersgruppen").
Population data are from [Bundesinstitut für Bevölkerungsforschung](https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Fakten/Fakt/B23-Altersgruppen-1871-Vorausberechnung.html).

## Source code

The jupyter notebook contains several experiments for heatmaps which compare the time frame 2000-2014 with the time frame 2015-2022. Those are **not** ready to use without confirming the source code and not self-explanatory. Therefore, only the line plots are published on the plot page above.

## Issues?

If you find issues with the line plots, please let me know.
