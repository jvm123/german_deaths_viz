## Intro

This page shows visualizations of the death counts per cause of death in the time frame 2000 to 2022 for Germany.

Each graph shows the development over time. The total death count "Insgesamt" is normed by the population size in the respective year, but the individual age groups are **not** normed by their actual size.

## Interpretation of the data
Be careful when interpreting these data!

Most developments have a plausible and simple reason. E.g., the apparently worsening situation for the age group 80+ is a simple consequence of the average age in that age group increasing.

Also, the size of the respective age groups vary from year to year, and this was **not** adjusted for. E.g., when more children are born, more deaths in the age group <20 will be observed, and the development in the graphics does therefore not necessarily indicate any change in the environment.

## Data sources
The source of the case numbers is [Destatis Genesis](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online#astructure) (search for "Gestorbene: Deutschland, Jahre, Todesursachen, Altersgruppen").
Population data are from [Bundesinstitut für Bevölkerungsforschung](https://www.bib.bund.de/DE/Fakten/Fakt/B23-Altersgruppen-1871-Vorausberechnung.html).
